# Node-Express-Handlebars aka Eat That Burger Wishlist

### Overview

This app allows you to create a wishlist of all the burgers you would like to try.  To get you started there will be a few burgers populated to the wishlist (along with one that the developer has already tried).  You may add as many burgers as you like to the wishlist.  Each time you or a friend tries one out you can "devour" it by clicking on the Devour button.  This will move your burger from your want to try list to your already tried list.
